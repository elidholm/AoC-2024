# Advent of Code 2024: A Programming Language Challenge 🎄💻

For this year’s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), I’ve decided to take on an extra challenge: solving each day’s problem in a different programming language!

## 🎯 The Challenge
- Every day, a programming language will be randomly selected from a predefined list using the [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/).
- Once a language is selected, it is removed from the list to avoid repetition.
- The list includes 20 different languages, with some repeats to reflect my familiarity:
  - **Python**, **Rust**, and **Julia** appear **3 times each**, as I have prior experience with them.
  - All other languages appear once for variety.

## 🛠️ The Languages
Here is the complete list of languages for the challenge:
- **Python** (x3)
- **Rust** (x3)
- **Julia** (x3)
- Javascript
- Zig
- C++
- Mojo
- Dart
- Haskell
- Typescript
- Kotlin
- Ruby
- Lua
- Bash
- Java
- OCaml
- Go
- Scala
- R
- Groovy

## 📝 Rules
1. The language of the day will be chosen randomly using the [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/).
2. Once a language is used, it will be removed from the wheel.
3. If the problem of the day is particularly challenging or time-consuming, I may take creative liberties to balance the difficulty with the limitations of the chosen language.

## 📁 Project Structure
Each day’s solution will be organized in the following structure:
```
/AoC-2024\
└── solutions/\
  ├── day01-zig/\
  │ ├── part1.zig\
  │ ├── part2.zig\
  │ ├── README.md\
  │ └── ...\
  ├── day02-scala/\
  │ ├── part1.scala\
  │ ├── part2.scala\
  │ ├── README.md\
  │ └── ...\
  └── ...\
```

### Daily Folder Contents
- `part[1|2].<ext>`: The solutions to both parts of the problem in the selected language for the day.
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the approach, challenges faced, and thoughts on the language used.

## 🌟 Why This Challenge?
Advent of Code is a fantastic opportunity to:
- Practice learning *how to learn* new things.
- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Explore and learn new programming languages.
- Challenge myself with unfamiliar tools and syntax.
- Have fun during the x-mas season!

## 🚀 Let’s Code!
Follow along as I attempt to tackle 25 days of Advent of Code in 20 different programming languages. Will I succeed? Let’s find out!
